# Add another

Add another is designed to save time during repetitive content creation. It allows the content creator to add another node of the same type much faster. The user interface modifications it provides to achieve this include:

* Add another message displayed after the user creates a node
* Add another tab on nodes to create further nodes of the same type
* Save and Add another button on node creation forms to allow the user to quickly create many nodes of the same type
